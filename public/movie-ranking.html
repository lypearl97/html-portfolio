<hr />
<ol>
    <li>The Witch: Subversion</li>
        <p>I love Kim Dami! Her performance here is superb.</p>
    <li>Jurrasic World</li>
        <p>I love the whole Jurassic movie series, but this is my fav out of all of them. It's just fun to see an operational dinosaur park.</p>
    <li>Resident Evil</li>
        <p>And of course, I love zombie films. These are one of the movie series that I keep on watching over and over.</p>
